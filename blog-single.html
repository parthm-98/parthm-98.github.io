													<p class="blogpara">
														The exponential rise of population over the last few decades has led a large number of elderly people, of whom a significant number do not have a good enough support system in place to provide them with sufficient welfare to be able lead comfortable lives. It is even more prominent in India, with the rise in the trend of nuclear families.
													</p>
													<p class="blogpara">
														The family members usually look towards old age homes or house nursing agencies for solutions, but these provisions are very small in number and extremely unorganized, leading to a sub optimum healthcare for the elderly.
														Moreover, health insurance in India is significantly limited and widely neglected when it comes to hospitalization and geriatric care, despite the rapid rise in the number of elderly people.
													</p>
													<p class="blogpara">
														The key challenges are to provide them with access to facilities that help them lead independent lives.

													<p class="blogpara">
														Being a remote internship, I was not actively involved in the research phase of the project.
														A project brief was handed over to me along with the findings of the research conducted by the HTIC team in MADRAS.
														My role was to make sense of the data collected.
													</p>
													<p class="blogpara">
														After understanding the data collected, I presented my findings to the team using USER PERSONAS.
														I specifically choose to represent my findings with the help of “user personas” since the team was well-versed with the different scenarios when and how the product will be used but were quite skeptical about the attributes, ambitions and feelings of our users.
													</p>
													<p class="blogpara">
														There are 3 main <strong>user personas</strong> that were discovered after the analysis of the research findings.

													<h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;font-weight: 700; color: #000;">Rolling out solutions.</h4>
													<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-top: 1em;"><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000;">Elderly people</span> need 24/7 support. Hence, a single caretaker looking after the needs of all the elderly people at the old age home will not be helpful. Secondly, elderly people are open to
														new technology. Hence, we concluded to make use of a smart watch. After this decision was made by the team we cross verified our predictions with the same user group and 90% of them were ready to use  smart wearables</p>
													<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000;">Caretakers</span> were facing problems since they could not immediately respond to emergencies. Also, they only understood what kind of any emergency it is after reaching the room of the elderly person or when the neighbours
														of the patient would hear them calling for help and then call the caretaker. Since, the caretakers were using smart devices we decided to use a tablet to keep track of the elderly people. A tablet was used since it was portable as well as due to the large screen size a larger number of elderly people could be tracked at a single glance. </p>
													<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000;">Family members</span> were not getting daily updates from the old age home. In case of an emergency, most of the times the family members were informed very late and hence they could not help much. As a result, we decided that the live data received from the watch will
														be sent to the respective family members of these elderly people using a mobile application. Hence, now the family members could get notifications and daily health updates.</p>

												    <p style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">
															When a feasibility test was conducted amongst the elderly people for determining the wearable device that could be easily accepted by them, the most common answer was a pendent (elderly people in India commonly wear such an ornament around their neck) and a watch.
															After doing market research and consolidating with the finance team we decided to proceed with a smart watch.

												    <p style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">
															Due to the constraints of the project, I had to design the tablet without getting feedback. We had to find caretakers that were well educated. India being the second largest digital market in the world we were confident
															that using the tablet would not be an issue for the caretakers. The various tasks of the caretaker are:
															<ul>
																<li> The most important task was to attend to an emergency at the right time.</li>
																<li> The caretaker should know what kind of an emergency it is (Eg. Medical or some other need).</li>
																<li> Keeping track of the location of the elderly. </li>
																<li> Analyse the daily physical activity of the elderly people.</li>

													<h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;font-weight: 600; color: #000;">3. Mobile app for family memberss.</h4>
													<p style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">
														The main aim for providing the app to family members of the elderly people was so that they can be informed about emergencies immediately.
														This would help in improving the efforts taken during emergencies since there might be some things that the family members could suggest the caretakers to do in certain cases.
														Also, having access to daily data will keep the family members well informed.
													</p>
													<p>
														Another surprising benefit of the app was that it helped to build conversations.
														Most of the elderly people said that they want to speak to their children and grandchildren more but they did not have any topics to talk about.
														Hence, most of the conversations consisted of formal pleasantries only. Having such data on hand could bridge this gap.
														Help in improving the conversations between them since now the family members have partial knowledge about the daily activities of their elders which would help in fostering meaningful conversations.

													<h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Limitations.</strong> </h3>
													<div class = "code">
														<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;line-height: 1.5;">
															Even though this system was positively accepted by my team at HTIC-IITM I was still unsure about certain things.
														</p>
														<ul>
															<li>What if 2 care-takers attend to the same emergency indicator?
																There is no provision to direct multiple caretakers to attend to multiple emergencies.</li>
															<li>Are we alienating our elderly more by surrounding them with technology?</li>
															<li>Mental health of the elderly has not been taken into consideration at all in this entire project.</li>
														</ul>
														<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;line-height: 1.5;">
															When these concerns were raised by me, I was assured that this much level of detail is not required
															right now since their main aim was to get the project approved and hope for some funding.
														</p>
													</div>
													<h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;  margin-top: 50px;"><strong>Conclusion.</strong> </h3>
													<div class = "code">
													<p style="line-height: 1.6; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 0px;">
														My thoughts on this project are that even though this is a great initiative, I am worried whether this will distance the elderly from the society.
														Is technology actually necessary here? Can we not take initiatives were we can foster building better communities by arranging for social gatherings,
														games and invite family members as well.
